## About the Collection

This collection is comprised of 3D models and still images of popular 21st century fiction from Katie Melsheimer's personal collection. The models were created using the Magiscan app and then exported to a GLTF file format being loaded into the collection. Each still image was caputred, edited, exported as a JPG file, and then uploaded into the collection.   

  
The metadata fields for title, date, publisher, subject, page numbers, and objectid were taken from the Library of Congress' catalog page for each title. You can find a guide on how to complete the metadata fields required for this collection [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmbsjVqlAgDVZoumsQ3CbgYSKEmactEOl21RY-A-cTY/edit?usp=sharing).
