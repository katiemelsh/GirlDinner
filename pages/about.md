## About the Collection

This collection is comprised of 3D models and still images of several popular 21st century fiction from my own personal collection. The models were created using the Magiscan app and then exported to a GLTF file format
being loaded into the collection. Each still image was caputred, then edited using Photoshop, exported as a JPG file, and then uploaded into the collection.
