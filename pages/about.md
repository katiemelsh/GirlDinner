## How to Use This Collection

This collection contains 3D models of books which are not supported in the UI. To view these models, navigate to the Browse page, locate and click on a book that you would like to view a model for, then click the Download button (located under the image of the signature page), and select the item that says "Book Title (model/gltf+json)". Once the item has downloaded, you can click to open the downloaded file on your computer's 3D View application. 

## About the Collection

This collection is comprised of 3D models and still images of popular 21st century fiction from Katie Melsheimer's personal collection. The models were created using the Magiscan app and then exported to a GLTF file format before being loaded into the collection. Each still image was caputred, edited, exported as a JPG file, and then uploaded into the collection.   

  
The metadata fields for title, date, publisher, subject, page numbers, and objectid were taken from the Library of Congress' catalog page for each title. You can find more information about how the metadata for this collection was configured, as well as a guide on how to complete the metadata fields required for this collection [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DmbsjVqlAgDVZoumsQ3CbgYSKEmactEOl21RY-A-cTY/edit?usp=sharing).  

All materials covered in this collection adhere to the requirements for Fair Use under the [Section 107 of the Copyright Act](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/).
